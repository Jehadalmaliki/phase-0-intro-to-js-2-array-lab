# Arrays Lab

## Learning Goals

- Practice writing arrays
- Practice using _destructive_ methods to manipulate arrays
- Practice using _nondestructive_ methods to manipulate arrays

## Introduction

We've learned about how arrays work and about the array methods built in to
JavaScript that we can use to manipulate them. Now it's time to practice what
we've learned.

If you haven't already, **fork and clone** this lab into your local environment.
Navigate into its directory in the terminal, then run `code .` to open the files
in Visual Studio Code.

## Instructions

Open up the `test` folder and take a look at `indexTest.js`. Note that some of
the names of the functions you will be writing begin with `destructively` and
some don't. This is a clue as to which `Array` method you will need to use for
each function.

Note also that the first test asks for an array called `cats`, set to an
initial value of `["Milo", "Otis", "Garfield"]`. In your functions, you will be
accessing and manipulating this array.

Near the top of `indexTest.js` you will see the following:

```js
beforeEach(function () {
  cats.length = 0;

  cats.push("Milo", "Otis", "Garfield");
});
```

What this code does is _reset_ the array to its original contents before each
test is run. The reason we need to do this is because some of your functions
will be _destructive_ â€” they will change the original `cats` array. This
is a problem because it means the input to the remaining functions will be
dependent on the outcome of other functions. It also means that the expected
return value of a function might change if the tests are run in a different
order. This makes it more difficult both to write tests in the first place and
to figure out how to get the tests to pass. Resetting the array returns us to a
blank slate between tests.

This is also a good illustration of why it's generally good practice to avoid
mutating a program's state whenever possible. If we use only _nondestructive_
methods, we have complete control over what's going into and coming out of the
function. This makes our programs more robust, easier to maintain, and less
prone to bugs.

Remember the workflow:

1. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
2. Run the tests using `npm test`.
3. Read the errors; vocalize what they're asking you to do.
4. Write code; repeat steps 2 and 3 often until a test passes.
5. Repeat as needed for the remaining tests.

After you have all the tests passing, remember to commit and push your changes
up to GitHub, then submit your work to Canvas using CodeGrade.

#solution :

The "appendCat" function takes a single argument, "name," which represents the name of the cat to be appended to the array. It uses the Array.prototype.concat() method to create and return a new array that is the result of concatenating the "name" argument to the "cats" array.

The "prependCat" function works similarly, but uses the Array.prototype.concat() method to create and return a new array that is the result of concatenating a new array containing the "name" argument to the "cats" array.

The "removeLastCat" function uses the Array.prototype.slice() method to create and return a new array that is a copy of the "cats" array, with the last element removed.

The "removeFirstCat" function works similarly, but uses the Array.prototype.slice() method to create and return a new array that is a copy of the "cats" array, with the first element removed.

I hope this helps clarify the implementation of these functions! Let me know if you have any additional questions.
